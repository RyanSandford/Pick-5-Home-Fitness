# Pick 5 Home Fitness

Pick 5 Home Fitness is an open source android application which provides daily, full-body, workout routines.
Using only body weight and everyday household items, Pick 5 Home Fitness is able to effectively target and
strengthen muscle groups often neglected by other equipment-less, home fitness programs. 

Pick 5 Home Fitness is able to target difficult muscle groups on the posterior chain, such as the hamstrings, back, 
and traps, without the use of any bands, weights, or pull-up bars. Using everyday household objects such as backpacks,
water bottles, paper, books, and towels (and a little bit of creativity), Pick 5 Home Fitness is able to effectively train 
these difficult muscle groups, often forgotten by traditional equipment-less fitness programs..

Each exercise contains a complete description and visual demonstration to making it easy for anyone to follow a workout. 
Recommended set and rep ranges ensure anyone can reach the proper training stimulus needed for muscle growth. Each exercise, 
as well as the corresponding set and rep range, were created by and tested on high caliber athletes to ensure their quality.
